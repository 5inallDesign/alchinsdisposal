<h1>Holiday Schedule</h1>

<p>Alchin's Disposal observes the following holidays: New Years's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day (4th of July), Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. If a holiday falls on a weekday (Monday-Friday) then routes are delayed by one day.</p>

<p>Should a holiday fall during the week (Monday-Friday) the routes will be delayed by one day. Thereafter, the routes will return to normal scheduled pick up days. For example, if your pick up day is Monday and a holiday we observe falls on that day the pick up day for that week only will be Tuesday.</p>
