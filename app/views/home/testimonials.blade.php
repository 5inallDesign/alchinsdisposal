<h1>Testimonials</h1>

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>My Name is Adrea E.I am writing this letter to express how much I appreciate your employee's service. I can tell he takes his job seriously and cares about others.</p>
<p>I was very impressed when... I was running late, an employee of yours did something unexpected. I was halfway down my driveway when I noticed the garbage truck was approaching my house. Expecting it to pass... the truck stopped, your employee jumped out and he ran up the drive to meet me. I thanked him several times before he was gone. I had another experience this past winter... I was again halfway down my driveway... the kind man backed his truck into our driveway to collect the trash.</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your service and generosity. In today's society customer service isn't always a priority. Thank you and keep up the good work.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>These days it seems that praise is few and far between for those who work their a$$es off and do a great job. Screw up once and the customer makes sure everybody, including other customers, know about it. I know I run a business too.</p>
<p>I was running late getting home from work last Thursday... So I'm approaching my driveway and the big Alchin truck has my driveway blocked while they are loading my neighbor's garbage. I have just enough room to get in my driveway and I hit my brakes, looked back and stopped my truck. I was going to see if maybe they could wait just long enough... nah, these guys are pretty quick... I roll 10 more feet and they're still there... I opened my door and asked if they could just give me a minute to get my garbage to the road.</p>
<p>I have had both of my hips replaced... The man that loads the truck must have noticed me struggling with both cans, he came up the driveway and grabbed the wheel-less can and took it back to the truck while I wheeled the other the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Now, to the whole point of my little note; you just don't see that kind of customer care anymore. That was the little extra measure taken by your employees that really struck me. What a nice bunch of folks you have working for you. I discussed this with the wife and we both agree on one thing. Those guys didn't have to wait, nor did they have to help me drag those cans. But they did and we really appreciate that help. Please let their boss and coworkers know how much we appreciate their help and kindness.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Alchin's Disposal:</p>
<p>We switched to your service over one year ago and have to tell you what a great job you have done. NOT ONCE in over a year did you miss a pick-up. This is a big change for us. We realize mistakes are made and do not demand perfection, however, perfection is what we have received. Your service is far &quot;superior&quot; to our previous provider. It is a relief to not have to wonder if our weekly pick-up will be made.</p>
<p>Your reliability is very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Staff,</p>
<p>Just wanted to add my testimonial about your company. In this day and age of companies raising rates like crazy, you have actually lowered yours. I can't tell you how much that means to us. This shows that you're interested in people, not just profit. Thank you for giving us all a well-needed break. You have the most excellent service and sales staff around. I wish other comnpanies would follow your example. We will all remember what you did for us during these hard financial times.</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>

<p>I just want to compliment your trash pick up employees. They are always friendly, always put my can back nicely, have even brought my can all the way up the drive-way in bad weather, reach in my can to empty everything completely. Nice job and you are appreciated.</p>
<h4>Thanks, Kristin &amp; Mike M.</h4>

<p>Didn't realize you had a website or I'd have written you long ago! We've been Alchin's customers for a long time. We'd like to say that a real standout for your business is Derek, the man that picks up at our house. Always smiling, always friendly, Derek does a great job and then some. He's quite the asset to your company!!</p>
<h4>Mr. and Mrs. Bob W.</h4>

<p>You guys are the best. I forgot to put my container right next to the street and your guys actually walked 20 feet and did it for us the day after Thanksgiving no less. I bet the day after a holiday is like being punished for the disposal guys trying to reel in the slack from the day off. How nice you have instilled the importance of customer service to your staff and they have taken it to heart. Waste Management would have taken that opportunity to &quot;floor it&quot; past our drive. Your service has been top notch. In a world where people are on the lookout for something to complain about. I feel it is important to catch people doing something right. And you folks are doing something right! Take a bow.</p>
