<p>Dear Alchin's</p>
<p>Thanks for keeping the costs so reasonable. Your company has been the only monthly bill that remained reasonable to my Social Security Budget.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Dear Staff,</p>
<p>Just wanted to add my testimonial about your company. In this day and age of companies raising rates like crazy, you have actually lowered yours. I can't tell you how much that means to us. This shows that you're interested in people, not just profit. Thank you for giving us all a well-needed break. You have the most excellent service and sales staff around. I wish other comnpanies would follow your example. We will all remember what you did for us during these hard financial times.</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>

<p>I just want to compliment your trash pick up employees. They are always friendly, always put my can back nicely, have even brought my can all the way up the drive-way in bad weather, reach in my can to empty everything completely. Nice job and you are appreciated.</p>
<h4>Thanks, Kristin &amp; Mike M.</h4>

<hr />

<p>Didn't realize you had a website or I'd have written you long ago! We've been Alchin's customers for a long time. We'd like to say that a real standout for your business is Derek, the man that picks up at our house. Always smiling, always friendly, Derek does a great job and then some. He's quite the asset to your company!!</p>
<h4>Mr. and Mrs. Bob W.</h4>

<hr />

<p>You guys are the best. I forgot to put my container right next to the street and your guys actually walked 20 feet and did it for us the day after Thanksgiving no less. I bet the day after a holiday is like being punished for the disposal guys trying to reel in the slack from the day off. How nice you have instilled the importance of customer service to your staff and they have taken it to heart. Waste Management would have taken that opportunity to &quot;floor it&quot; past our drive. Your service has been top notch. In a world where people are on the lookout for something to complain about. I feel it is important to catch people doing something right. And you folks are doing something right! Take a bow.</p>

<h4>Love, The Near Family</h4>
